# Black Jack Project 1

## Overview 
The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. A deck of 52 cards is created, shuffled and dealt by a computer dealer.

After cards are dealt, the player has the option to hit (receive another card) or stay (keep their current hand). Only the dealer's first card is shown to the player. Once a player completes their turn, the dealer will hit if their hand value is 16 or lower, otherwise they stand. Once the dealer completes their turn, their cards are revealed and a winner is decided.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this game.

## Getting Started

## Next Steps
In the future, I'd like to create actual playing cards that display on the page instead of just the suit and value. Also, I'd like to improve the games overall UX and design to make it more user friendly.
